    %h1 Gravacat!
    %h3 The (completely) illegitimate offspring of #{link_to "{placekitten}", "http://www.placekitten.com"} and #{link_to "Gravatar", "http://www.gravatar.com"}
  %p 
    Are you 
      %em tired
    of users not bothering to upload an avatar onto your site? Do you need to create a bunch of fake users and are bored of the default Gravatar icon? Well then Gravacat is for you!
  %p Simply include some sort of hash of your user's email address after the slash and we'll send you your very own tiny cat picture!
  %p
    Example: 
      %code http://gravacat.trevorfenn.info/<hash here> 
  %p (Or use random, rand, or r to get a random one every time)
  %p
    %small Right now all images are 200x200, so deal with it.
  %p
    %small Images stay consistent until more images are uploaded
  .images = getImages(@num_images)
